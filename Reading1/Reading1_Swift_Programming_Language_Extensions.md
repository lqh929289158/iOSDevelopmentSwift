# Extensions

Motivation: Add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumertation or protocpol!

> NOTE: _Retroactive modeling_ you are able to extend types for which you do not have access to the original source code.

Extensions in Swift can:

- Add computed instance properties and computed type properties.
- Define instance methods and type methods.
- Provide new initializers.
- Define subscripts.
- Define and use new nested types.
- Make an exisiting type conform to a protocol.

> WARNING: Extensions can add new functionalitiy to a type. But they can not override existing functionality.
